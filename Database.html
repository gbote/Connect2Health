I hope to create an impact in my community. As for Connect2Health, I wanted to work on it because I wanted to gain experience in working with other people and other programming languages. The opportunity to help others find an easier way to access healthcare information is crucial to many who do not understand the nook and crannies of healthcare.</p>

										<p align = "center">Hello everyone! My name is Gerardo Rafael Bote, and the reason why I wanted to contributed to Connect2Health is because of my personal connections to the healthcare industry. As a son of a sexual assault nurse examiner, I get to hear of stories of how many victims and those affected by abuse and pain are not able to get the help they need just because of how difficult it is to look for the right resource they need. Via Connect2Health, I hope to help people find the correct information through our diverse set of healthcare resources.	</p>

										<p align = "center">Hey ya'll! My name is Anthony Hiep Nguyen. I'm currently a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin and am majoring in Computer Science. I began working on Connect2Health because I did not grow up with the best healthcare. Because of that I wanted to help with this project and make healthcare more accessible to people. The opportunity to help others, while also gaining experience in the domain of computer science was a no brainer for me. I hope many people use the website, and are able to access the healthcare that they require.</p>
